ZODIAC INNOVATION — PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: October 29, 2025

At Zodiac Innovation, your privacy is our priority. This Privacy Policy
describes how we handle information when you use our applications and
services.

1.  INFORMATION WE COLLECT We do not collect, store, or share any
    personal information. Our applications are designed to function
    without requiring personally identifiable data such as names, email
    addresses, phone numbers, location, or device identifiers.

2.  PERMISSIONS Some of our apps may request limited permissions
    strictly for functionality (for example, access to storage for
    saving files or camera for in-app content creation). These
    permissions are used solely within the app for their intended
    purpose and are never used to collect or transmit personal data.

3.  DATA STORAGE AND SHARING We do not collect or transmit user data to
    any external servers. All user-generated content remains stored
    locally on the user’s device unless the user explicitly chooses to
    share or export data through standard system interfaces. We do not
    share, sell, or disclose any user information to third parties,
    advertisers, or affiliates.

4.  THIRD-PARTY SERVICES Our applications do not include third-party
    analytics, advertising networks, or social tracking tools. If a
    future app integrates such services, they will comply with
    applicable laws and require your explicit consent.

5.  CHILDREN’S PRIVACY Our applications are suitable for general
    audiences. We do not knowingly collect or store any personal data
    from children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age in your
    jurisdiction).

6.  INTERNATIONAL COMPLIANCE Zodiac Innovation complies with privacy
    regulations including:

-   The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR – European Union)
-   The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA – United States)
-   COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act – United States)
-   Applicable data protection laws in other jurisdictions where our
    apps are distributed.

7.  CHANGES TO THIS POLICY We may update this Privacy Policy
    occasionally to reflect legal, technical, or operational changes.
    Any updates will be posted with a revised “Last Updated” date.
